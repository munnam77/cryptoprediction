# Crypto Day Trading Dashboard System Architecture

## Overview
The Crypto Day Trading Dashboard is a real-time prediction and monitoring system built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It focuses on low-cap cryptocurrencies with high growth potential, providing multi-timeframe analysis and predictions.

## System Components

### 1. Data Layer
- **DatabaseService**: Handles data persistence using Vercel Postgres
  - Raw price and volume data storage
  - Prediction history with timestamps
  - Market metadata (e.g., market cap, liquidity scores)
  - Timeframe-specific metrics

- **CacheService**: In-memory caching for high-frequency data
  - Price data caching (5s TTL)
  - Market data caching (5m TTL)
  - Prediction results caching (variable TTL based on timeframe)

### 2. Data Collection
- **BinanceService**: Real-time market data collection
  - WebSocket connections for live price updates 
  - REST API calls for historical data
  - Market depth and orderbook data
  - Configurable update intervals per timeframe

### 3. Prediction Engine
- **PredictionService**: Multi-timeframe prediction system
  - Machine learning models (LSTM, Transformer)
  - Technical analysis indicators
  - Volume profile analysis
  - Sentiment analysis integration

- **ErrorCorrectionSystem**: Prediction accuracy improvement
  - Real-time accuracy tracking
  - Model performance monitoring
  - Adaptive learning based on historical accuracy

### 4. Monitoring & Validation
- **DataValidationService**: Data quality assurance
  - Real-time data validation
  - Cross-source data consistency checks
  - Stale data detection
  - Error and warning reporting

- **PerformanceMonitor**: System health monitoring
  - Response time tracking
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Error rate tracking
  - Resource utilization metrics

### 5. Alert System
- **AlertSystem**: User-configurable alerts
  - Price change notifications
  - Volume spike detection
  - Custom threshold alerts
  - Browser and sound notifications

## API Endpoints

  - symbol: string (e.g., "BTCUSDT")
  - timeframe: "15m" | "30m" | "1h" | "4h" | "1d"
Response: {
  price: number;
  volume: number;
  timeframeChangePct: number;
  volumeChangePct: number;
  volatilityScore: number;
  liquidityScore: number;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Predictions
```typescript
GET /api/predictions
Query Parameters:
  - symbol: string
  - timeframe: "15m" | "30m" | "1h" | "4h" | "1d"
Response: {
  symbol: string;
  timeframe: string;
  predictedGain: number;

  confidence: number;
  timestamp: number;
  actualPerformance?: number;
}
```

### Alerts
```typescript
POST /api/alerts
Body: {
  symbol: string;
  type: "price" | "volume";
  timeframe: "15m" | "30m" | "1h" | "4h" | "1d";
  threshold: number;
  direction: "above" | "below";
}
Response: {
  id: string;
  created: number;
  status: "active" | "triggered";
}
```

### System Status
```typescript
GET /api/system/health
Response: {
  status: "healthy" | "degraded" | "error";
  services: {
    database: boolean;
    cache: boolean;
    prediction: boolean;
    binance: boolean;
  };
  metrics: {
    responseTime: number;
    errorRate: number;
    memoryUsage: number;
    uptime: number;
  };
}
```

## Data Flow
1. **Real-time Data Collection**
   - Binance WebSocket connections stream live price data
   - Data is validated and stored in both cache and database
   - Different update frequencies per timeframe

2. **Prediction Process**
   - Raw data is processed through technical indicators
   - ML models generate predictions per timeframe
   - Results are cached and stored with confidence scores
   - Actual performance is tracked for accuracy improvement

3. **User Interface Updates**
   - Components subscribe to relevant data streams
   - Real-time updates through WebSocket connections
   - Cached data used for non-critical information
   - Progressive loading for historical data

4. **Alert Processing**
   - Alert conditions checked against real-time data
   - Triggered alerts stored in database
   - Push notifications sent through browser API
   - Alert history maintained for user reference

## Error Handling
- Retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Fallback to cached data during outages
- Graceful degradation of features
- Error reporting and logging
- Automated recovery procedures

## Performance Optimizations
- Multi-level caching strategy
- Batch processing for historical data
- WebSocket connection pooling
- Query optimization for time-series data
- Lazy loading of non-critical components

## Security Measures
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Data validation and sanitization
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Error message sanitization
- API key rotation and management

## Monitoring and Alerts
- System health monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource utilization alerts
- Data quality validation

## Deployment Architecture
- Vercel hosting platform
- Vercel Postgres database
- Edge functions for API routes
- CDN for static assets
- WebSocket servers for real-time data
